    "## Gradient Boosting (Adaboost)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost is much stronger than the Logistic Regresssion or the SVM we learnt. Adaboost is highly non-linear and yet does not suffer much from overfitting. Therefore Adaboost is considered as an out-of-the-box machine learning that you can expect to get a decent performance on various challenging tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind Adaboost algorithm is to \"Iteratively boost the performance of a model by penalizing more on misclassified observations\". The keyword here is **Iteratively**. Both Logistic Regression and SVM are one-shot classifiers: they have one model to predict the target variable $y$ and we don't do anyhing further on the misclassification errors made $e = y - \\hat{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in figure, Adaboost works with a set of weak classifiers $\\{G_{m}\\}_{m=1}^{M}$(for this tutorial, we define the classifiers with simple tree models). A classifier at time = $m$: $G_{m}$ tries to refine from the error made at the previous model iteration $y \\neq G_{m-1}(x)$.\n",
